This folder encludes codes to generate simple label-free samples such as dots, lines and curves of random sizes and distributions.  Complex label-free samples can refer to some edge extracted gray animation patterns which have complex and diverse structures. The labeled samples can refer to the BioSR data through this link "https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BioSR/13264793" , which is shared by Qionghai Dai and Dong Li in the research article "Evaluation and development of deep neural networks for image super-resolution in optical microscopy".
